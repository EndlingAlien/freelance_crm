# EndlingCRM (freelance_crm)

**Freelance CRM** is a streamlined, MySQL-based client relationship management tool designed for solo freelancers who want to keep their projects, clients, and invoices neatly organized. It’s a Python + basic GUI project focusing on clean data management and practical features that help manage freelance workflows without bloat.

Everything here — from the database design to the interface — is built by me with an emphasis on simplicity and functionality that real freelancers need.

## Why I Made This

I wanted to create a no-nonsense CRM tailored for freelancers who juggle multiple clients and projects. Most CRMs are either too complex or too generic. This project aims to give me a solid SQL and GUI practice while building something useful for managing work, deadlines, and payments.

It’s an early-stage project, but it’s laying a foundation for something flexible and scalable.
